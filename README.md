## Encryption-Decryption

This is a JetBrains project of the Kotlin basics track to learn how to work with files and command line.

### About
Privacy is an important matter in the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, it's a must that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. And the fact is that the whole modern web is encrypted, take HTTPS for example! Don’t stay behind — hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

### Stages
1. **Encrypted!** -> Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.
2. **Knowledge is key** -> Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher.
3. **Decrypted** -> Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table
4. **I command you** -> Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.
5. **X-files** -> Work with files: learn to store your data in a file.
6. **Choice, choice -> Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
